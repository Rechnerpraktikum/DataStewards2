# maDMP to human readable DMP

## How it works
Our solution uses [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/) templates to convert the provided JSON maDMP (via the `-d` argument) to an HTML string (styled with CSS to match the template) which is subsequently converted to PDF with the [pdfkit](https://pypi.org/project/pdfkit/) package.

The text used to make the maDMP more "human-like" is specified directly in the template, which makes tweaking and changing it quite straight-forward. The mapping of maDMP fields to the template structure can also be changed right inside of the Jinja template. This approach makes it easy for non-coders to adjust the template to their needs with very basic HTML and Jinja knowledge needed. 

## How to run
0. (Use Pyhton 3.7)
1. Clone [repository](https://github.com/datastewardstuw/DataStewards2)
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required packages
3. `cd` to `src` directory
4. Run `python main.py -d path/to/dmp.json -t [FWF|HORIZON]`

The `-d` argument specifies the path of the maDMP to convert (e.g. `../dmps/DMP_ML_slim.json`), while the `-t` argument specifies the template to use, which can be either `FWF` or `HORIZON`.

The original DMPs can be found in the repository as well inside the `original` directory, while the maDMP versions are located in the `dmps` directory. There are several versions of the `DMP_ML` with different levels of completeness, which were used to test the output our converter generates when fields are missing.

The generated human readable DMPS are located in the `dmps` directory as well, and are named after the JSON files they originate from, adding either `FWF` or `HORIZON` depending on which template was used, and `out` to be able to discern them from the input files (not only based on the file extension).

An example DMP generated with the FWF template is shown below:

## Comparison

As a first step two Data Management Plans have been created and manually converted into machine-actionable DMPs. In a further step they have been converted back again into a human-readable format. The workflow looks simplified as follows:

human-readable (pdf) &rarr; machine-actionable (json) &rarr; human-readable (pdf)

In order to compare the original and the converted DMPs we have created a table with the categories for each section, which are part of the relevant DMP templates. They are either FWF or Horizon 2020. As a start we will do a short overview (1) how they differ. For each category we will check where (2) information got lost and (3) which elements are more detailed. To finish we will discuss (4) which parts of the maDMP were how difficult to generate. 

### Original vs. Generated DMP

The templates of the DMPs have been designed to match the available templates of the FWF and the Horizon 2020 demo reports. Therefore, they have a much clearer appereance compared to the used online editors (like [DMPOnline](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk)).
